# StackGuard Assignment: Hugging Face

## Objective

Design and implement an API-based system that scans Hugging Face-hosted assets (models, datasets, and spaces) for potential secrets and tokens using regex-based pattern matching.
The system should produce structured JSON results that can later integrate with StackGuard's secret scanning binary.

## Problem Statement

StackGuard wants to extend its secret scanning capabilities to AI model ecosystems.
You need to build a backend API that:

- Fetches files from Hugging Face resources (Model / Dataset / Space).
- Scans their content using regex-based secret detectors.
- Returns structured findings via API responses.
- Optionally persists and contextualizes results for visualization.

## API Requirements

### 1. Scan Endpoint

**POST** `/api/scan`

Request Body Example:

```json
{
    "model_id": "microsoft/phi-3",
    "dataset_id": null,
    "space_id": null,
    "org": "microsoft",
    "user": null,
    "include_discussions": true,
    "include_prs": false
}
```

Expected Behavior:

- Use Hugging Face Hub API to fetch files, discussions, and PRs for the provided IDs.
- Run regex-based scanning for secrets (e.g. ghp_, AKIA, AIza, slack-bot-token, etc.).
- Return structured JSON results like:

```json
{
    "scan_id": "SG-2025-1012-001",
    "scanned_resources": [
        {
            "type": "model",
            "id": "microsoft/phi-3",
            "findings": [
                {
                    "secret_type": "AWS Access Key",
                    "pattern": "AKIA********",
                    "file": "config.json",
                    "line": 24
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-12T12:30:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Results Storage Endpoint

**POST** `/api/store`

Body: JSON output of the scan

Functionality:

- Store the scan results in a local database (SQLite / Mongo / Postgres).
- Add metadata: context, scan_source, detected_at.

Return confirmation:

```json
{ "status": "stored", "scan_id": "SG-2025-1012-001" }
```

### 3. Fetch Results Endpoint

**GET** `/api/results/{scan_id}`

Returns stored scan details and contextual metadata

## Implementation Notes

- Backend language: Go or Python (FastAPI/Flask) preferred.
- Use Hugging Face Hub API to fetch resources.
- Use 10–20 regex patterns for secret detection.
- Output must be JSON structured, ready for later integration with StackGuard's binary.
- Add error handling, rate limiting, and logging where appropriate.

## Showcase

- A lightweight dashboard endpoint (`/api/dashboard`) to show all stored results grouped by resource type and severity.
- Add organization-level scanning support — fetch all models/datasets/spaces under a given org/user.

## Timeframe

- **Submission Deadline:** 2–3 days
- Submit your GitHub repository link with a short README explaining setup and approach.
